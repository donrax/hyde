I'm a Deep Learning & Computer Vision Engineer with a strong background in Research and Development working in Applied Research
<!--- <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> -->

<!---  #### Philosophy -->
<!---  Walking the line between academic research and industry, with the goal of applying distilled perspectives in a usable manner to practical problems. -->

<!---  Novel ideas originating from the field of 'Artificial Learning' and ideas originating from creativity. -->

#### Interests
My current focus is the development and adaptation of robust and scalable Deep Learning based Computer Vision models for real-time production-grade applications geared toward segmentation and detection problems

#### Affiliation
My Bachelor's thesis was in the field of Machine Learning on feature selection in imbalanced real-world datasets. My Master's thesis was in the field of Computer Vision on improving object localization in real-world images. I completed my Ph.D. dissertation in the field of Deep Learning while working as an applied research scientist for a company focused on specialized visual quality-control solutions for the Pharma Industry. My focus is the development of robust and scalable Deep Learning based Computer Vision models for real-time production-grade applications. This includes MLOps development and the vertical-and-horizontal integration of the Deep Learning process into existing company processes and solutions.
